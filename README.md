## The stuff of subject programs

This repository includes categories and corresponding choices, metamorphic relations, and test frames of subjects programes used in paper titled "Feedback-Directed Metamorphic Testing: ACost-Effective Approach".

### Categories and Corresponding Chocies
All categories and choices for ACMS, CUBS, ERS, MOS, and FastJson can be found in the *categories and choices* directory. 

### Test Frames
In order to make the description of the test frames more concise, we use some simple symbols to replace the concrte choices. Those symbols can be found in the *categories and choices* directory.

### Metamorphic Relations
All metamorphic relations of ACMS, CUBS, ERS, MOS, and FastJson can be found in the *metamorphic relations* directory.
